# aToolTracker

## Description

A simple tool tracker application, that keeps inventory of my wood, metal, and hobby working tools I have in my physical toolboxes.

### Who is this application for?

- Me
- Any hobbiest who would want to keep track of equipment from computers to wood working tools.
- Anyone who happens to be bored out of thier minds
- Any Business owner who happens to lose track of thier tools who want something pretty basic unless you want expansions then you will need to ask me or donate, I don't program out of my good will, this guy needs to eat and play with new dev toys.

### Why build this web app since there are so many others

- Just because it's the only way to learn new technologies.
- Because of a need to keep inventory since I have many addictions not just programming and wood working.

### Licensing and in the event in the future.

I will change the license accordingly if I happened to have to support this application if someone asks me anything on github to fix a broken feature or wants to ask me to add something to this project well. I will kindly ask for you to donate to this project.  Depending on the amount will depend on what's asked or donated.

This project is ongoing even if it's slow.  Once I have achieved a product that can be delievered then the license will go from MIT to a license that we all can be happy about.
